# GitHub README for the "Manage Data for an Online Grocer Using MySQL Workbench" Repository

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skill set in using MySQL Workbench. The project I have used to showcase these skills “Managing Data for an Online Grocer Using MySQL Workbench” can be found on the Coursera website [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/showcase-manage-data-online-grocer-mysql-workbench).

For this project I have been assigned by the fictional online grocery company GreenSpot to take the spreadsheet provided and design a database that can organize and store the given data. I then have to test and verify the design of my database by creating several SQL join queries, each using multiple tables to examine GreenSpot's products.

In order to show how I have completed this project successfully, I have added eight different files to this repository. Six are .png image files meant to easily and comprehensively display spreadsheets, SQL queries (and the successful results), and an EER diagram of the project's database. The other two are .sql files that show the built database and the SQL queries. 

**_A Brief Explanation of the Repository Files_**


**GreenSpotData.png** – An image file of the original spreadsheet given in the Coursera project website. It is with this spreadsheet that we are to make our new database.

**GreenSpotDataClean.png** – An image file of the spreadsheet that has had its data cleaned and has been reorganized to show which columns will be grouped together in their respective tables.

**EERDiagram.png** – An Image file of the EER diagram used to show the tables and their corresponding relations in the database. As you can see in this image, the Product table has a One-to-Many relationship with the three other tables.

**GreenSpotScript.sql** – The SQL script that was used to build the database.

**GreenSpotQuery.sql** – The SQL queries that were used to test the database and the relationship between it's tables.

**PriceQuery.png** – An image file displaying the results of the SQL query that looks up the price of each product unit.

**TotalCostQuery.png** -  An image file displaying the results of the SQL query that looks up the total cost of purchased orders organized by date.

**TotalOnHandQuery.png** -  An image file displaying the results of the SQL query that looks up total product in stock.
